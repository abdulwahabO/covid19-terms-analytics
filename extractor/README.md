# About
 
 This a Java program that opens a persistent HTTP connection to Twitter's 
 [Filtered Stream API*](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/filtered-stream/overview) from which it consumes
 tweets as they are sent in realtime and writes tweet metadata to a Kafka broker.
 
 
 *Only available in the Twitter Developer Labs program as of August 2020.
